## Introduction
The "Marks Manager" program is designed to help manage the marks of students and perform various operations on the data. It allows users to load data from files, add new marks, delete marks, sort the data, view all records, and search for a specific student's record.

## Features
1. **Load Data:** The program allows users to load student data and marks from two files named "STUDENT.DAT" and "MARKS.DAT."

2. **Save Data:** Users can save the data, including magic number, weightage, evaluation count, and marks data, to the "MARKS.DAT" file.

3. **Add Marks:** Users can add new marks for each student. The program validates the input to ensure it is within the specified range.

4. **Delete Marks:** Users can delete a specific component's marks for all students. The program sets the marks for that component to zero.

5. **Sort Data:** The program provides options to sort the data based on the user's choice. Users can sort the data by roll number (ascending or descending) or by total marks (ascending or descending).

6. **View All Records:** Users can view all student records along with their marks and total marks. The program displays the data in a tabular format.

7. **View Specific Record:** Users can search for a specific student's record by providing their roll number. The program displays the details of the specified student.

8. **Colorful Output:** The program uses console text color manipulation to enhance the visual appearance and make the user interface more user-friendly.

9. **Data Validation:** The program ensures that the user enters valid inputs for various operations, such as adding marks or selecting menu options.

10. **Statistics Calculation:** The program calculates statistics such as total marks and weightage for each student and stores them in a two-dimensional array named "Statistics."

These features make the "Marks Manager" program a useful tool for managing and analyzing student marks efficiently. It allows users to load, modify, sort, and view student data, providing valuable insights into student performance.

## Libraries and Constants
The program utilizes C++ standard libraries and defines several constants to represent different colors for console output. The colors are used to enhance the visual appearance of the program.

## Global Variables
The program uses several global variables to store important information such as student IDs, marks, total marks, weightage, and statistical data.


## Main Function
The main function executes the program's logic by repeatedly presenting the main menu and performing the corresponding operations based on the user's choice. The program continues executing until the user chooses to exit (option 8).


## How to Use
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the C++ code using a compatible compiler.
3. Run the executable to launch the "Marks Manager" program.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to navigate the menu and perform various operations.
